# Requests

To request a new source or bug fix, [create an issue](https://github.com/cuong-tran/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

Note that requesting something does not imply that something will be added or fixed in a timely fashion or at all since the work is volunteer-based. Furthermore, some sources may be impossible to do or prohibitively difficult to maintain.

If you would like to see a request fulfilled and have the necessary skills to do so, consider contributing! Issues are up-for-grabs for any developer if there is no assigned user already.
